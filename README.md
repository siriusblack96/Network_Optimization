# Network_Optimization
The goal of this project is to find the maximum bandwidth path in the routing network considered as
a graph with the weights as the maximum bandwidth of the edge or the connection between two
nodes. In this project, the well-know algorithms like Dijkstra’s and Kruskal Maximum Spanning
Tree are modified to solve for the maximum bandwidth path in the network. The Dijkstra’s
algorithm has been implemented in two ways i.e. using heap and without using heap data
structure. All the algorithms have been tested on two types of randomly generated graphs: a
sparse graph and a dense graph. The comparison of the average execution time of the three
algorithmic approaches is done to analyse the theoretical and practical complexities of this
algorithms.
